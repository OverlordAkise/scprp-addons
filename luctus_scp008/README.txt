To setup SCP008 you need both entities:

The "SCP 008 DoorChecker" entity has to be placed INSIDE the hatch that opens with SCP008.
You can do this by opening the hatch, placing the DoorChecker where the hatch was, perma-prop'ing it and closing the hatc.

The entity checks if the door doesnt touch the DoorChecker anymore, if yes then the infections start.
If the hatch closes it touches the DoorChecker again and the infections stop.

The "SCP 008 Spreader" needs to be placed where it can see all of the room and the hallway leading to the room.
It can simply be permapropped where it should be. Only one Spreader can be used at once (for performance reasons).

Every player who has a direct line between the spreader and themselves start getting infected if the Hatch opens. (aka.: The DoorChecker doesnt touch the hatch anymore)
